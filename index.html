					    For a long time computer scientists have been erasing time from programming, and we're now putting it back in. For a long time computer musicians have been trying to hide the computation in their music, and we're celebrating it.

						<blockquote>
							The boundary between a piece and an instrument is deliberately vague, and it can fluctuate. [...] The instrument incorporates notational elements, but conversely the notational is becoming increasingly instrumental and systematic.

						<blockquote>Many have claimed that 'The laptop is the new folk guitar'; if this is so, then PB_UP is the first acoustic computer music folk band: The laptop is their only instrument. It was synthesizer, realtime sound processor, networking device, and now it is understood as a fully autonomous musical instrument, including being its own hand-held sound system:

							player + laptop = improviser + instrument = music.</blockquote>

				  > A musical practice of the future emerges, which no longer waits for the development of new types of musical instruments, but takes over instruments that were not specially built for music. And it is precisely because of their limited, ideologically restricted musical use that they become relevant to music - as well as records, tape recorders, radios and other devices of apparently only technical value, which only reproduce sounds.

				  <h3> Tutorial </h3>

				  Let's see some basic Sardine patterns.

				  <section>
				    <pre>
				      <code data-trim data-noescape class="language-python">
					@swim
					def pat():
					    D("bd")
					    again(pat)
				      </code>
				    </pre>
				    <aside class="notes">
				      `swim` indicates that the function is called again regularly, in rhythm<br>

				      The definition of the function follows the ususal Python syntax.<br>

				      `D` indicates that the pattern passed as an argument is sent to SuperDirt to be interpreted as a musical pattern<br>

				      For now our pattern only contains one kick-drum sound, but we will see just now more complex ones.<br>

				      `again` indicates that once the function is done with its musical duties, it schedules itself to be called again at the next bar
				    </aside>
				  </section>

				  <section>
				    <pre>
				      <code data-trim data-noescape class="language-python">
					@swim
					def pat(i=0):
					    D("bd sd", i=i)
					    again(pat, i=i+1)
				      </code>
				    </pre>
				    <aside class="notes">
				      We have now added a snare drum to our pattern, which now spans two beats.<br>

				      We have to indicate which part of the pattern is played at a particular call of the function.<br>

				      This is done using an iterator argument, here called `i`, which, as it is implemented here, indicates how many times the function has already been called (starts at zero, is incremented of one at each successive call).
				    </aside>

				  <section>
				    <pre>
				      <code data-trim data-noescape class="language-python">
					@swim
					def pat(i=0):
					    D("bd sd", i=i)
					    D("synth", midinote="C4 E4 G4 B4", i=i)
					    again(pat, i=i+1)
				      </code>
				    </pre>
				    <aside class="notes">
				      We can add another pattern to be played simultaneously.<br>

				      The main pattern has only one element, which specifies the instrument, and the pitch is indicated by a secondary pattern passed to the argument `midinote`.<br>
				      We here play an arpeggio over the course of four beats.

					    D("synth", midinote="C4@maj7", i=i)
					    again(pat, i=i+1)
				      </code>
				    </pre>
				    <aside class="notes">
				      This pattern can be rewritten with a chord name shorthand. Numerous scales and chords presets are integrated in the language.
